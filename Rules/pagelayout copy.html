				<br>
				</strong><small>Coaches, players and friends of football view holding
				opponents and the non-enforcement of holding as a major concern. During the
				past decade, this foul has risen from being low on the list of infractions to
				the most frequently penalized violation. The Football Rules Committee receives
				many complaints about illegal tactics. Grabbing opponents' shirts and
				encircling their bodies with outstretched arms are the most prominent. The
				illegal blocking techniques of grasping, encircling, clamping or otherwise
				impeding defensive players to neutralize a charge are infiltrating the game at
				an alarming rate. Recent changes in football rules have liberalized the use of
				hands and arms in legal blocking activities and offensive players must
				correctly use these techniques in neutralizing opponents. Coaches and players
				should thoroughly understand the rules for proper offensive and defensive use
				of hands. The teaching of intentional holding will break down rather that aid
				in the building of the character of players.</small><br>
				<br>
				<strong><small>Attitudes</small><br>
				<br>
				</strong><small>Players have responded well to recently implemented rules
				prohibiting fighting, demeaning opponents and choreographed demonstrations.
				Teams are to be commended for showing proper respect for opponents as well as
				displaying strong school spirit. Uniforms have become much more representative
				of high schools, colleges and universities with concentration on identical
				helmets, shirts, pants and socks.</small><br>
				<br>
				<strong><small>Sportsmanship</small><br>
				<br>
				</strong><small>The football player who intentionally violates a rule is
				guilty of unfair play and unsportsmanlike conduct; and whether or not he
				escapes being penalized, he brings discredit tot he good name of the game,
				which it is his duty as a player to uphold.</small></font></p>
