			  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			  Member officials of the Texas Association of Sports Officials (TASO) have a duty
			  to act as impartial judges of interscholastic sports competitions. This duty
			  carries with it an obligation to perform with accuracy, fairness and
			  objectivity. Though member officials work contests played by amateur athletes,
			  every official must approach each game assignment in a professional manner.
			  Because of their role in athletic competition, member officials must have a high
			  degree of commitment and expertise. It is because of this role that a high
			  ethical standard is imposed on TASO members.</font></p>
			  <p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">SECTION 2 - PURPOSE</font></b></p>
			  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Code
