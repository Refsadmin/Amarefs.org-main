			<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial">~ PROTECTION AND COURTESY TO GAME
			OFFICIALS. ~</font></b>
			</p><p><font face="Arial">All schools, when they join the League and are assigned to
			a district, accept the respective athletic plans. The code states in part
			"To accept decisions of officials without protest; to see that officials
			are extended protection and courtesy, by players, school personnel and laymen;
			to treat your opponents as your guests, and to put clean play and real
			sportsmanship above victories."</font>
			</p><p><font face="Arial">The State Executive Committee has assessed more penalties
			to coaches and players for abuse of game officials than for any other one rule
			violation. There can be no athletic activities without officials. Unless they
			are protected, the educational benefits of athletics could be denied to high
			school pupils. Officials must be mutually agreed upon in advance. If no prior
			agreement is reached, beginning the game constitutes agreement. It is strongly
			recommended that:</font>
			</p><ol type="1">
			  <li><font face="Arial">Police protection be furnished at all football games.
				The officers should meet the game officials and escort them to dressing
				facilities, before and after the game. Officers should be situated on the
				field so that they can protect the officials.</font>
			  </li><li><font face="Arial">Each member school should construct a fence around the
				playing field to restrain fans from moving onto the field. In many cases
				where officials are abused, there has not been an adequate fence or barrier
				around the field.</font>
			  </li><li><font face="Arial">The public address system should be used prior to each
				game to explain to the fans the meaning of the football code and that the
				officials are guests of both teams and should be so treated. Pre-game
				announcements along with the playing of the National Anthem are also
				recommended to help create a proper atmosphere.</font></li>
			</ol>
			<p><font face="Arial">It is the responsibility of the coach to set the example
			of proper conduct toward officials. The coach, through his actions, generally
			sets off the "spark" which results in misconduct of lay people toward
			the officials. The coach sets the proper example in conduct, to students and to
			the fans. The coach as a member of the school faculty is evaluated very
			critically by the League, in any case of mistreatment of officials.</font>
			</p><p><font face="Arial">For all varsity athletic contests, a designated
			administrator is to be appointed to act as a security and hospitality aide for
			officials. Official's chapters should be notified prior to the season or game as
			to procedures for items such as parking, dressing rooms, security, and method of
			payment.</font>
			</p><p><font face="Arial">If an attack should occur on a game official, the school
			administration and the school board should take immediate steps to see that the
			person making the attack on the official or officials is apprehended, charged,
			and prosecuted. The school must see that the guilty person is brought to
			justice. Token punishments will not carry much weight.</font>
			</p><p><font face="Arial">Schools must take proper precautions to see that all game
			officials are protected and extended courtesy. In case of any misconduct by a
			fan, player or a coach schools should prosecute this person to the legal limits.
			Proper preparation can prevent most misconduct relative to officials.</font>
			</p><p><font face="Arial">NOTE: If extreme verbal abuse is directed toward an
			official or if an official is struck, pushed, bumped, or handled in any way,
			there shall be a penalty assessed by the State Executive Committee. This penalty
			will be either: 1) public reprimand; 2) disqualification; 3) suspension from
			coaching high school football. THINK BEFORE YOU LOSE YOUR TEMPER!</font>
